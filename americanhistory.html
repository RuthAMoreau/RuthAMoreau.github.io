	<h1>American History</h1>
  	<p>The land which became the United States was inhabited by Native Americans for tens of thousands of years; <br>their descendants include but may not be limited to 574 federally recognized tribes. <br>The history of the present-day United States began in 1607 with the establishment of Jamestown <br>in modern-day Virginia by settlers who arrived from the Kingdom of England, and the landing of the Mayflower by English pilgrims to Plymouth in 1620. <br>In the late 15th century, European colonization began and largely decimated Indigenous societies through wars and epidemics. <br>By the 1760s, the Thirteen Colonies, then part of British America and the Kingdom of Great Britain, were established. <br>The Southern Colonies built an agricultural system on slave labor and enslaving millions from Africa. <br>After the British victory over the Kingdom of France in the French and Indian Wars, <br>Parliament imposed a series of taxes and issued the Intolerable Acts on the colonies in 1773, which were designed to end self-governance. <br>Tensions between the colonies and British authorities subsequently intensified, <br>leading to the Revolutionary War, which commenced with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. <br>In June 1775, the Second Continental Congress established the Continental Army and unanimously selected George Washington as its commander-in-chief. <br>The following year, on July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously declared its independence, issuing the Declaration of Independence. <br>On September 3, 1783, in the Treaty of Paris, the British acknowledged the independence and sovereignty of the Thirteen Colonies, leading to the establishment of the United States. <br>On September 17, 1787, the U.S. Constitution was signed by a majority of delegates, and was later ratified by the Thirteen Colonies, leading to first modern U.S. government.</p>
