	<h1>Modern History</h1>
  	<p>The modern era or the modern period is considered the current historical period of human history. <br>It was originally applied to the history of Europe and Western history for events that came after the Middle Ages, <br>often from around the year 1500, like the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism. <br>Since the 1990s, it has been more common among historians to refer to the period after the Middle Ages and up to the 19th century <br>as the early modern period. <br>The modern period is today more often used for events from the 19th century until today. <br>The time from the end of World War II (1945) can also be described as being part of contemporary history. <br>The common definition of the modern period today is often associated with events like the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, <br>and the transition from nationalism toward the liberal international order.</p>
